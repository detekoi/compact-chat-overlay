# Enhanced Patches for Twitch Chat Overlay

This update implements fixes for two key issues with the Twitch Chat Overlay:

1. Theme generation reliability with retry logic
2. localStorage management and cleanup

## 1. Theme Generation with Retry Logic

### Problem
The theme generation would fail completely if it received an invalid response from the API, showing an error message without trying again.

### Solution
Implemented exponential backoff retry logic:
- Automatically retries failed theme generation up to 3 times
- Starts with a 1-second delay, doubling after each retry (1s → 2s → 4s)
- Shows clear feedback in the UI during retries
- Only shows error message if all retries fail
- Validates response data before processing

### Files
- `js/retry-theme-generator.js` - Contains the enhanced theme generation logic with retry mechanism

## 2. Enhanced Storage Management

### Problem
The app was hitting localStorage capacity limits (5MB quota) and showing errors when trying to save settings, even though the settings appeared to be saved on refresh.

### Solution
Implemented a more aggressive and intelligent storage cleanup approach:
- Added a "Clear Browser Storage" button to settings when storage is near capacity
- Improved cleanup algorithm to remove background images from inactive scenes
- Implemented tiered cleanup strategy:
  1. Standard cleanup: Removes old theme images and unused configs
  2. Aggressive cleanup: Removes all theme-related data except current scene
  3. Manual clearing: Allows user to completely reset storage while preserving essential config
- Added visual warning when storage is near capacity
- Performs cleanup proactively before generating new themes

### Files
- `js/utils/enhanced-storage-cleanup.js` - Contains improved storage management logic

## Installation

The changes are applied automatically by the new loader script:

```html
<script src="auto-apply-enhanced-patches.js"></script>
```

This script replaces the previous `auto-apply-patch.js` and handles loading all enhanced patches in the correct order.

## Technical Details

### Storage Management
The enhanced storage cleanup adds several improvements:
- More accurate storage usage measurement
- Targeted removal of large items like background images
- Scene-specific cleanup to preserve current scene settings
- User feedback and manual cleanup options

### Theme Generation
The retry mechanism uses modern async/await patterns with try/catch blocks to:
- Cleanly handle API errors
- Provide better user feedback during retries
- Validate response data before processing
- Seamlessly integrate with the existing theme application logic

## Usage Notes

- The theme generator will now show retry progress in the UI
- If storage is critically full, you'll see a "Clear Browser Storage" button in settings
- The system will automatically try to manage storage, but may prompt for manual cleanup in extreme cases
